The comparison between FROG and our baselines is illustrated in the figures for various scenarios using the Elephants Dream (ED) and Big Buck Bunny (BBB) SVC video sets. In this context, "ED-1x1y" denotes the evaluation of the ED SVC video set with one server-side OF switch (1x) and one client-side OF switch (1y), while "BBB-4x2y" represents the evaluation of the BBB SVC video set with four server-side switches (4x) and two client-side switches (2y). "P" indicates tests with Poisson-distributed bandwidth capacities.
