# FROG Evaluation Results

This repository presents additional evaluation results for **FROG** and the baseline approaches under various network and video configurations.  
The comparisons are shown through figures generated from experiments using the **Elephants Dream (ED)** and **Big Buck Bunny (BBB)** SVC video sets.
Note: "P" suffix â†’ Denotes tests conducted with **Poisson-distributed bandwidth capacities**.

## Notes

These figures complement the main paper by providing additional experimental insights that could not be included due to page limitations.  
All evaluations use the same optimization, network configurations, and parameter settings as described in the paper.
